Lab 1-1: Temperature Converter
==============================

Lab Requirements and Specifications
-----------------------------------

In this lab, you will be creating two different programs to convert temperature values between Fahrenheit and Celcius.  One program will convert Fahrenheit to Celcius, and the other program will convert Celcius to Fahrenheit.

Each program should use ``input()`` to allow the user to type in a number to convert.  The program will perform some math, then display an output formatted like:

.. code-block:: none
	
	15 C is equal to 32 F

To convert from Celcius to Fahrenheit, you would use the following equation:

.. math::
  T_f = T_c \times 1.8 + 32

To convert from Fahrenheit to Celcius, you would use the following equation:

.. math::
	T_c = \frac{(T_f - 32)}{1.8}

Where :math:`T_c` is the temperature in Celcius and :math:`T_f` is the temperature in Fahrenheit.

You should create two files in your workspace:
	- ``FILN_calcFtoC.py``
	- ``FILN_calcCtoF.py``

Where "FILN" is your first initial and last name, all lowercase, no space.

As a reminder, you should be running this program using python3.  Running this program using python2 may give you unexpected results!  If you are getting errors, make sure you look over your code and double-check for typos.  If you are getting numbers that seem way off, make sure that the equations are entered in correctly!  Don't forget your order of operations!

Testing Your Program
--------------------

You can test your program ``calcFtoC.py`` by feeding it the following (input) numbers and comparing your output to the result:

	+-----------+------------+
	| Input (F) | Result (C) |
	+===========+============+
	| 32        | 0          |
	+-----------+------------+
	| -13       | -25        |
	+-----------+------------+
	| 100       | 37.777     |
	+-----------+------------+
	| 63.8      | 17.666     |
	+-----------+------------+

You can test your program ``calcCtoF.py`` by feeding it the following (input) numbers and comparing your output to the result:

	+-----------+------------+
	| Input (C) | Result (F) |
	+===========+============+
	| 0         | 32         |
	+-----------+------------+
	| 25        | 77         |
	+-----------+------------+
	| 100       | 212        |
	+-----------+------------+
	| -33       | -27.4      |
	+-----------+------------+
