Lesson 03-02: Python's Error Messages
=====================================

**Learning Target: I can interpret error messages to debug code.**

*Note: All errors and screenshots in this lesson are from a python console, and may not be the exact same message from the errors you would get from this site.*

Types of Errors
---------------

Over the course of learning programming, you will come across many different types of errors.  In most programming languages, whenever an error stops program execution, you will also see an :vocab-word:`error message` - which :vocab-def:`provides information about the error, including where it is and what type of error it is`.

For example, if we were to run the following code in a as a python program:

::
   
   print("hi")
   print "there"

When we execute this program, we would see:

.. code-block:: none
   
        File "/path/to/file.py", line 2
          print "there"
                      ^
   SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'

There is some very important information here!  Let's break it down.
