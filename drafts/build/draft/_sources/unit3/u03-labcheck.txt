Unit 3 Pre-Lab Check
====================

Unit 3 Learning Targets
-----------------------

This is the end of Unit 3!  You are free to move onto the Unit 3 Labs, but before you do, please review the learning targets for Unit 3 and make sure you are comfortable with them.

1. I can differentiate between semantic, runtime, and syntax errors.
2. I can interpret error messages to debug code.
3. I can document my code with appropriate comments.
4. I can use good naming conventions with variables.
5. I can know when to use variables instead of hard-coding numbers.
6. I can use for loops to repeat a set of instructions.
7. I can use the range function to generate a specific list of numbers.
8. I can use for loops to iterate over a range of numbers.
9. I can write an accumulator algorithm.
10. I can use while loops to repeat a set of instructions.
11. I can ensure that my while loop does not run forever.
12. I can use the break keyword to end a loop early.
13. I can use for-else loops to test whether a for loop has completed or not.
14. I can use the random module to generate random numbers.
