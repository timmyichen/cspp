Lesson 01-01: Datatypes in Python
=================================

**Learning Target: I can describe the ways in which Python can represent data.**

What is data?
-------------

Everything you see right now is data.  Cellular signals flying through the air is data.  A text message, a song, a video, is all data.  Even though data comes in many forms, there are some very :vocab-def:`simple representations of data`, called :vocab-word:`basic datatypes`, that we will be learning about.  

In Python, the five basic datatypes that we will be learning are:
	- :vocab-word:`int`

	  ``int`` is short for :vocab-def:`integer, which means any whole number` (a number with no decimals).  In Python, a number is an int when it has no decimal point.

	  Examples of integers are: ``1``, ``-402``, ``9999999``

	- :vocab-word:`float`

	  ``float`` is short for :vocab-def:`floating point number, which, simply put, is a more specific way of representing numbers - this allows us to use decimals`.  In Python, a number is a float when it has a decimal point and a number following the decimal point.

	  Examples of floats are: ``0.0001``, ``-402.0``, ``1234.5678``

	- :vocab-word:`string`

	  A ``string`` is another way of saying :vocab-def:`text - representing letters, digits, and symbols`.  In Python, data is a string when it is surrounded by single or double quotes.

	  Examples of strings are: ``"x"``, ``'a string'``, ``"2#%a  bcd&  *1 *64jed#@ (*S )"``

	- :vocab-word:`boolean`

	  A ``boolean`` is a :vocab-def:`datatype with only two values - True or False`.  In Python, boolean values are represented by the words ``True`` and ``False`` - no quotes - and be sure to capitalize the first letter!

	  The only two boolean values are: ``True``, ``False``

	- :vocab-word:`NoneType`

	  Interestingly enough, the ``NoneType`` in python is :vocab-def:`a datatype that represents no value`.  In Python, "no value" is represented by the word ``None`` - no quotes - and again, capitalize the first letter!

	  The only NoneType value is: ``None``

.. mchoice:: question01_04_01
	:correct: c
	:answer_a: int
	:answer_b: float
	:answer_c: string
	:answer_d: boolean
	:feedback_a: int is short for integer, which is a number. Try again! Hint: What datatype uses quotes?
	:feedback_b: float is short for floating point number. Try again! Hint: What datatype uses quotes?
	:feedback_c: Great job - only strings will use quotes!
	:feedback_d: There are only two values for boolean - True and False. Try again! Hint: What datatype uses quotes?

	What datatype would ``"Nice to meet you!"`` be?

.. mchoice:: question01_04_02
	:multiple_answers:
	:correct: b,d
	:answer_a: boolean
	:answer_b: int
	:answer_c: string
	:answer_d: float
	:feedback_a: Boolean has two values, while there are certainly more than two numbers in existence!
	:feedback_b: integers are numbers!
	:feedback_c: Strings use quotes, which numbers don't need..
	:feedback_d: floats are short for floating point numbers!

	Which of the following datatypes represent types of numbers?

.. dragndrop:: question_01_04_03
	:feedback: You can look back to the notes if you need to!
	:match_1: float|||Decimal number
	:match_2: boolean|||True/False
	:match_3: int|||Whole number
	:match_4: NoneType|||Always None
	:match_5: string|||Text, uses quotes
