Lesson 04-11: CT Pillar: Decomposition
======================================

**Learning Target: I can break down problems through decomposition and describe its role in computational thinking.**

Pillars of Computational Thinking:
   - **Decomposition**
   - Abstraction
   - Pattern Recognition
   - Algorithms

Breaking Down Problems
----------------------

In Lesson 04-09, we talked briefly about using functions to break down problems.  One of the pillars of computational thinking is **decomposition**.  Decomposition is taking a complex problem and breaking it down into smaller parts - and perhaps each of those parts will need to be decomposed further.

Decomposition is both a process and a mindset - the process is actually taking a problem and breaking it down, whereas the mindset is being able to think in terms of smaller processes and recognizing when a function can be broken down.  Both can be built with experience and reflection.  It's always a great idea to go back to older proj ects and think about how they can be improved upon.
