Lesson 00-01: Introduction to the Course
========================================

Welcome to this online interactive textbook!  This book is meant to serve as an introduction to computer science through the Python programming lauguage, aligned to the new Computer Science Principles Advanced Placement test by the CollegeBoard.

This is a project created by Timothy Chen, a high school computer science teacher at the Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology, to be used with the 10th grade Software Engineering class.  He can be contacted at tchen@uagateway.org.  Please feel free to reach out with suggestions, bug reports, or things that are just plain wrong that need to be fixed ASAP.

What is Computer Science?
-------------------------

Computer science is, at it's base, the study of computation, constantly asking the question: *What is computable?*  Computer science is a very broad field that revolves around algorithms, which are just step-by-step instructions.  For what, you might ask?  For anything, from simple calculations to complex data processing.

Through this course, we will touch upon the basics of various introductory computer science topics, such as programming, binary and hexadecimal number systems, searching and sorting algorithms, and more.

What is Programming?
--------------------

Programming is computer science - but the reverse is not true: Computer science is *not* programming.  It was explained to me as follows: Computer science is about computation and what is computable, but how do we compute?  Through programming.  However, you can certainly study computer science without programming.

In this book, we use Python as our programming language.  Why Python?

   - Python is a popular, powerful scripting language
   - Python code is relatively easy to read and follow along
   - It forces you to structure your code neatly (tabbing)
   - Many online tutorials and tools to help you out
   - Many libraries exist to help you do cool stuff with python

We will be using python to create text-based games and create ciphertext tools - being able to encrypt and decrypt messages, and being able to crack encrypted messages.  Hopefully, through this course, you will learn to channel your creativity and your programming skills to solve problems.

How To Use This Course?
