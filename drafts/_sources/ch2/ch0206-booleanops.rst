Lesson 02-06: Boolean Operators
===============================

**Learning Target: I can use boolean operators to compare values**

Comparison Operators
--------------------

Now that we've famliarized ourselves with the basic boolean operators, let's dive a little bit deeper.  These next set of boolean operators will enable us to compare values.  These operators are:

   +--------------------------+----------+
   | Description              | Operator |
   +==========================+==========+
   | Equals                   | ``==``   |
   +--------------------------+----------+
   | Not Equals               | ``!=``   |
   +--------------------------+----------+
   | Greater Than             | ``>``    |
   +--------------------------+----------+
   | Less Than                | ``<``    |
   +--------------------------+----------+
   | Greater Than or Equal to | ``>=``   |
   +--------------------------+----------+
   | Less Than or Equal to    | ``<=``   |
   +--------------------------+----------+

With the exception of ``==`` and ``!=``, these operators should seem fairly familiar - you probably encountered them in your math class when discussing *inequalities*.
